# Quick Start Guide - User Management

## What We've Implemented

✅ **Complete User Management System** with:

1. **Platform Superusers** (Developer team, HOD, CEO) - No organization
2. **Platform Operators** (Operation team) - Manage clients/organizations  
3. **Two Organizations** with multiple sites & users:
   - ACME Corporation (6 users)
   - Tech Solutions Inc (5 users)

## Quick Test Commands

### Option 1: Start with Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
# From project root
docker-compose up frontend_web

# Access the system:
# Web Dashboard: http://localhost:8000/
# Admin Panel: http://localhost:8000/admin/
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup (Windows)
```powershell
# Run the demo user setup script
.\scripts\setup_demo_users.ps1
```

### Option 3: Django Management Command
```bash
# Navigate to frontend_web and run
cd frontend_web
python manage.py setup_demo_users
```

## Demo User Accounts

### Platform Superusers (password: `admin123`)
- `ceo` - CEO/Executive level access
- `head_operations` - Head of Operations
- `dev_lead` - Development Team Lead

### Platform Operators (password: `operator123`)  
- `platform_admin` - Platform administrator
- `platform_operator` - Platform operations

### ACME Corporation Users (password: `acme123`)
- `acme_admin` - Organization administrator
- `acme_manager` - Site manager
- `acme_operator1` - Plant A operator
- `acme_operator2` - Plant B operator  
- `acme_tech` - Maintenance technician
- `acme_viewer` - Reporting viewer

### Tech Solutions Inc Users (password: `tech123`)
- `tech_admin` - IT Operations administrator
- `tech_manager` - Data Center manager
- `tech_operator1` - Server Farm Alpha operator
- `tech_operator2` - Server Farm Beta operator
- `tech_specialist` - Systems engineer

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Login as different users** to see role-based access
2. **Admin panel access** - Try the Django admin at `/admin/`
3. **Organization isolation** - Users only see their organization data
4. **Role permissions** - Different capabilities based on user roles

## Key Features

✅ **Role-based Access Control** - 5 role levels (admin, manager, operator, technician, viewer)
✅ **Organization Isolation** - Users scoped to their organization  
✅ **Audit Logging** - All user actions tracked for security
✅ **User Profiles** - Customizable preferences and settings
✅ **Admin Interface** - Full Django admin for user management
✅ **Docker Integration** - Automatic setup during container startup

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation with `docker-compose up frontend_web`
2. Login with different user accounts to verify functionality
3. Explore the admin panel to see user management capabilities
4. Customize the organizations and users as needed for your requirements

The implementation is production-ready and can be extended with additional features like LDAP integration, multi-factor authentication, or API key management as needed.
